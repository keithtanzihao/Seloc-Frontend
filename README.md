Access to the live demo [here](https://dreamy-clarke-097e90.netlify.app/)

# Project Summary

### Project Context

Our physical and mental health are key indicators of how we will perform as human beings, and throughout the COVID pandemic, there has been a prevalence of anxiety, burnout and higher levels of reported cases of depression. These problems in turn affects our overall ability to carry out essential activities in our daily lives and strips us of the ability to understand and communicate our emotions with love ones. However, mental issues like depression usually take time to manifest and thus these early symptoms can and should be combatted early. 

### User Goals

The website aims to provide a platform where users can create and look up existing wellbeing techniques/programs which targets various physical and mental health painpoints. A search function with filter options is also valiable to allow users to quickly find a program to suit their needs. Lastly, users can also login to comment on these techniques allowing users who created them to better identify areas the program can improve on. The website also needs to be responsive and work on multiple mobile platforms ranging from small phones to large screen desktops.

### Justification for the App

While wellbeing guides can be found online, the majority of them either lack clear instructions or contain too many irrelavant information. At the same time alot of these guides are too generic and often lack professional advice. Thus this website will serve as a wiki for users who genuine want to provide effective advice and techniques to improve people's wellbeing so as to combat the rising of mental health problems. With the addition of a comment section, users can also better identify well curated programs while avoiding ones that have a low score, and users who created these programs can also use the feedback from comments to better improve their techniques.
